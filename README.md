# 📝 Momento
Momento is a modern Notes and To-Do app built with **Jetpack Compose**.  
It uses **Room DB** for local storage, **WorkManager** for to-do alerts, and follows a clean **MVVM architecture** with **Koin** for dependency injection.  
Asynchronous operations are handled with **Kotlin Coroutines**.  
UI is built with **Material 3** for a smooth and modern experience.
